						<h3>About Us</h3>

						<div>

							Epsilon is one of the younger guilds within the SIGMA ALLIANCE, created in June 2017.  We have made quick and steady progress over the last 8+ months.  Epsilon is a semi-casual guild, in that we have slightly relaxed requirements for daily ticket contribution.  But don’t let the semi-casual description fool you, you will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy!  We are an energetic guild with a strong base of members who are excited to continue to increase our power together as a guild. 

							<br />

							<br />
							Our guild refresh time is at 3:30pm EST.

							<br />

							In the most recent Light Side Territory Battles, we achieved 27 stars.

							<br />
							
							In the most recent Dark Side Territory Battles, we achieved 27 stars.

							<br />

							Epsilon Leadership:

							<ul>

								<li>Guild Leader: Seeterio</li>
								<li>Raid Master: Swampgas23</li>

								<li>Guild Officers: K0T0R, eXsaNiTy, Ukyu, Mitth, Eraxis, Cirdan, LikeCoolPerson</li>

							</ul>

						</div>

						<h3>Requirements for Membership</h3>

						<div>

							Epsilon has recently crossed the 70 million total guild GP threshold.  As such, we are looking for members with a minimum of 1,400,000 total GP.  We also require members to have a public swgoh.gg profile, use Discord for guild chat, and follow guild rules as outlined below.
						</div>

						<h3>Raids / Territory Battles / Territory Wars</h3>

						<h5>hRancor Raid ("The Pit"): HEROIC</h5>

						<div>

							<ul>

								<li>Launch and ZERG occur at 8:30pm EST</li>

								<li>Upon launch, the first 24 hours is a zero damage phase. This allows all members time to ‘register’ for the raid by sending one toon in on a zero damage suicide mission, in order to become eligible for raid rewards.</li>

								<li>After the 24 hour zero damage phase, an officer will call ZERG. Once ZERG has been called, members are free to post damage.</li>

								<li>Pre-loading is acceptable, but we ask pre-loaders to wait until at least 8:45pm EDT to post solo damage.</li>
							</ul>

						</div>

						<h5>hAAT Raid ("Tank Takedown"): HEROIC</h5>

						<div>

							<ul>

								<li>Launch and ZERG occur at 8:30pm EST</li>

								<li>Upon launch, the first 24 hours is a zero damage phase. This allows all members time to ‘register’ for the raid by sending one toon in on a zero damage suicide mission, in order to become eligible for raid rewards.</li>

								<li>After the 24 hour zero damage phase, an officer will call ZERG. Once ZERG has been called, members are free to post damage.</li>

								<li>We have a hAAT team Google Docs spreadsheet that we require all members to complete with the raid team composition that they run in hAAT.  We expect all members to achieve a minimum of 2% damage in all four phases of hAAT.</li>

							</ul>

						</div>
						
						<h5>Sith Triumvirate Raid</h5>
						
						<div>
						
							<ul>
							
								<li>We are currently running T4 Sith Triumvirate Raids.</li>
								
								<li>As soon as the raid is launched, it is open to attack.  There is no zero-damage phase.</li>

								<li>We require all members to do their best and post damage with five teams each day, but we do not have any minimum guild requirements for teams or toons at this time.</li>

							</ul>
							
						</div>

						<h5>Territory Battles</h5>
						
						<div>
							
							<ul>
						
								<li>Members should use common sense and follow general direction provided by guild leadership.  We do not micromanage every platoon decision, but provide general guidance as to what territory the guild should be focusing on in order to maximize number of stars.</li>
								
								<li>Light Side TB</li>
								
								<ul>
								
									<li>Members are required to complete 20+ combat mission waves.</li>
									
									<li>Members are required to have 5* Captain Han Solo and 5* Hoth Rebel Soldier.</li>

									<li>Requirements will steadily increase as we grow.</li>
									
								</ul>


								<li>Dark Side TB</li>
								
								<ul>
								
									<li>Members are required to complete 20+ combat mission waves.</li>
									
									<li>Members are required to have 5* Colonel Starck and 5* General Veers.</li>

									<li>Requirements will steadily increase as we grow.</li>
									
								</ul>
				
							</ul>

						</div>
						
						<h5>Territory Wars</h5>
						
						<div>
							
							<ul>
						
								<li>All members are required to join Territory Wars, so we can be guaranteed the maximum possible rewards regardless of winning or losing.  The penalty for not joining Territory Wars for first time offense is a strike.  Second offense will result in removal from the guild, with re-invitation back at the discretion of officers.</li>

								<li>Follow guidance posted on Discord for setting defensive strategy.</li>
				
							</ul>

						</div>

						<h3>Guild Rules</h3>

						<div>

							<ul>

								<li>Discord</li>

								<ul>

									<li>All members must have a Discord account, and check in on Discord regularly, ideally once or twice a day. Raid announcements, guild updates, and other information is primarily distributed through Discord. We encourage all members to be active on Discord, as Discord offers access and interaction with other members within the SIGMA ALLIANCE community.</li>

									<li>Please keep Discord chat content PG-rated.</li>

									<li>Please do not troll or spam in the Discord chat rooms.</li>

									<li>Please be respectful and polite towards others.</li>

								</ul>

							</ul>

							<ul>

								<li>Ticket Contribution</li>

								<ul>

									<li>All members should be aiming to contribute 600 tickets per day.</li>

									<li>Minimum ticket contribution is 3,500 tickets per week.</li>

									<li>Post in #leave_of_absence channel on Discord if you’ll be away from the game and unable to complete tickets.</li>

								</ul>

							</ul>

							<ul>

								<li>24 Maximum Galactic War Battles</li>

								<ul>

									<li>On every Tuesday/Wednesday, the guild activity is Galactic War battles. While it is possible to potentially achieve 36 battles, we require members to limit themselves to 24 battles maximum. This gives everyone in the guild the ability to reach #1 rank for contribution for the day.  The penalty for going over 24 nodes for first time offense is a strike.  Second offense will result in immediate removal from the guild and re-invitation back after guild refresh (at the discretion of officers).</li>

								</ul>

							</ul>

							<ul>

								<li>Other Rules</li>

								<ul>

									<li>Please respect the guild leadership. Our officers work very hard to make the guild run smoothly. Sometimes mistakes get made. Please be understanding, and if you are unhappy with something, or feel you have been treated unfairly, please openly bring it to the attention of an officer or the guild leader.</li>

									<li>If you are unsure of any of the rules, please check out <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D3Xg2vY9ta3Q&sa=D&ust=1510098696789000&usg=AFQjCNH8zRpiiPBtWKf3z-twkT5KEY1lwA">this youtube video</a>, which answers some frequently asked questions!</li>

								</ul>

							</ul>

						</div>

						<h3>Disciplinary</h3>

						<div>

						Mistakes happen, and we're generally very understanding here in Epsilon.  However, in order for our guild to progress and meet our maximum potential, we have implemented a 3 strike system.  Strikes are issued for failure to meet minimum ticket requirements, failure to follow Territory Battle direction, or violation of any of the guild rules.  Strikes are issued at the discretion of guild leadership.

							<ul>

								<li>1st Strike: fair warning</li>

								<li>2nd Strike: serious warning, potential removal from guild depending on severity of offense</li>

								<li>3rd Strike: certain removal from guild</li>

							</ul>

						Strikes are purged after a month, so members will not be in danger of guild removal unless multiple rule violations occur within a relatively short time frame.
